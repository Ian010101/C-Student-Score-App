# C-Student-Score-App
By Ian Anhalt

This application was made in my C# class and used Visual Studio ide. This is one of my first slightly bigger projects that involved a lot of small features in the application. So far everything is functional and has plenty of checks in place to ensure no errors occur when the user inputs new data. Will be slowly updating the project and making it more complex as time goes on.

The application allows the user to input new data for a student that involves both their name and their scores from tests. Specific descriptions of each test and other details about them has not been implemented yet and will be in the future. The user can add, delete, and update scores for each student.
